# CSI-Stillwater-Iphone-SWIFT
snippets of code for CSI: Stillwater. Due to this being a team project, multiple code pages have been excluded

An "unblock" me game where the user tried to re-arrange blocks in order to push out a "special" block out of the puzzle. The game uses a police car and is "CSI" themed.

This repository only includes snippets of code or small examples to be used for portfolio examples. Large portions of the project 
have been excluded due to privacy concerns since it was created by a team effort.
